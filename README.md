## 📌 Projects

### 🚀 Featured Project: Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Communication Framework
Building a **distributed agent architecture** that enables autonomous agents to discover, coordinate, and execute tasks reliably.

**Highlights**
- Designed and implemented a standardized protocol for agent discovery + collaboration using **JSON-RPC 2.0** and **Agent Card JSON**.
- Built an **async FastAPI** service to expose agent capabilities as modular tools/sub-agents (microservice-style).
- Orchestrated multi-agent workflows with **LangGraph**, focusing on reliable state management and robust interactions across agent nodes.

**Current focus**
- Reliability: retries/timeouts, schema validation, deterministic tool invocation
- Scalability: async concurrency, structured logging/metrics, modular agent integration

### 📨 Spam Mail Classifier (Logistic Regression)
- Developed a **logistic regression** classifier for email categorization, achieving **92% accuracy** and **F1=0.90** on an unseen test set.
- Evaluated with **5-fold cross-validation** to handle class imbalance; tuned decision threshold to balance precision/recall.
- Engineered features using **TF-IDF and regex-based pattern extraction**; optimized thresholds using **F1/Precision/Recall**.


### 🏠 Housing Price Predictor (Regression)
- Built an end-to-end **scikit-learn regression pipeline** to predict residential property values.
- Performed extensive EDA and data cleaning on **500k+ records**, addressing outliers, missing values, and skewed distributions.
- Metrics: **MAE=$[fill] / RMSE=$[fill] / R²=[fill]** (recommended to report CV results)

## 🧪 Research / Experience

### UC Berkeley Data Discovery × Ten Strands — Student Researcher (Sep 2025 – Dec 2025)
- Quantified the impact of dedicated staffing on environmental literacy across **938 CA school districts**.
- Analyzed relationships between district-level attributes and environmental investments; improved dataset completeness by imputing missing political-lean features using **2020 vote-share**, enabling statewide longitudinal comparisons.
